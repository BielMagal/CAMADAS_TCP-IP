Temples of Syrinx 4:33</p><p>We've taken care of everything<br>The words you hear the songs you sing<br>The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes.</p><p>It's one for all and all for one<br>We work together common sons<br>Never need to wonder how or why.</p><p>We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx<br>Our great computers<br>Fill the hallowed halls<br>We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx<br>All the gifts of life<br>Are held within our walls</p><p>Look around this world we made<br>Equality our stock in trade<br>Come and join the Brotherhood of Man<br>Oh what a nice contented world!<br>Let the banners be unfurled<br>Hold the Red Star proudly high in hand.</p><p>We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx<br>Our great computers<br>Fill the hallowed halls<br>We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx<br>All the gifts of life<br>Are held within our walls</p><p>III. Discovery 6:45</p><p>What can this strange device be?<br>When I touch it, it gives forth a sound<br>It's got wires that vibrate and give music<br>What can this thing be that I found?</p><p>See how it sings like a sad heart<br>And joyously screams out its pain<br>Sounds that build high like a mountain<br>Or notes that fall gently like rain.</p><p>I can't wait to share this new wonder<br>The people will all see its light<br>Let them all make their own music<br>The Priests praise my name on this night.</p><p>IV. Presentation 10:14</p><p>I know it's most unusual<br>To come before you so<br>But I've found an ancient miracle<br>I thought that you should know</p><p>Listen to my music<br>And hear what it can do<br>There's something here as strong as life<br>I know that it will reach you.</p><p>Yes, we know it's nothing new<br>It's just a waste of time<br>We have no need for ancient ways<br>The world is doing fine</p><p>Another toy will help destroy<br>The elder race of man<br>Forget about your silly whim<br>It doesn't fit the plan.</p><p>I can't believe you're saying<br>These things just can't be true<br>Our world could use this beauty<br>Just think what we might do.</p><p>Listen to my music<br>And hear what it can do<br>There's something here as strong as life<br>I know that it will reach you.</p><p>Don't annoy us further<br>We have our work to do.<br>Just think about the average<br>What use have they for you?</p><p>Another toy will help destroy<br>The elder race of man<br>Forget about your silly whim<br>It doesn't fit the plan.</p><p>V. Oracle: The Dream 13:56</p><p>I wandered home though the silent streets<br>And fell into a fitful sleep<br>Escape to realms beyond the night<br>Dream can't you show me the light?</p><p>I stand atop a spiral stair<br>An oracle confronts me there<br>He leads me on light years away<br>Through astral nights, galactic days</p><p>I see the works of gifted hands<br>That grace this strange and wondrous land<br>I see the hand of man arise<br>With hungry mind and open eyes</p><p>They left the planet long ago<br>The elder race still learn and grow<br>Their power grows with purpose strong<br>To claim the home where they belong<br>Home, to tear the Temples down...<br>Home, to change.</p><p>VI. Soliloquy 15:56</p><p>The sleep is still in my eyes<br>The dream is still in my head<br>I heave a sigh and sadly smile<br>And lie a while in bed<br>I wish that it might come to pass<br>Not fade like all my dreams</p><p>Just think of what my life might be<br>In a world like I have seen<br>I don't think I can carry on<br>Carry on this cold and empty life<br>Oh...no.</p><p>My spirits are low in the depths of despair<br>My lifeblood spills over.</p><p>VII. The Grand Finale 18:17</p><p>Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation<br>Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation<br>Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation<br>We have assumed control.<br>We have assumed control.<br>We have assumed control.</p> </article>
